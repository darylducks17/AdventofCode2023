# Advent of Code 2023

## [Day 1 ](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/1)

### [Part 1](day1/answers.py)
I've completed this correctly albeit the code being inefficient and messy.

### [Part 2](day1/answers.py) 
I thought the question was asking for the first and last worded digits of the strings, converting them to numbers and then calculating the sum. However, my answer has not picked up all worded digits like twone, oneight etc. 

## [Day 2](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/2)

### [Part 1](day2/answers.py)
This was definitely hard, I kind of the got the logic behind it, but I definitely did use Chat GPT and VS Code Debugger to help me put the code together. 

### [Part 2](day2/answers.py)
I'll probably try this later >.<
